# Unity 360° Video Player - Setup Verification

## ✅ GUID Errors Fixed Successfully

All Unity compilation and GUID reference errors have been resolved:

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Scene File GUID References** - Updated to use correct prefab GUIDs
2. **Prefab Instance References** - Fixed all broken PPtr references  
3. **Script References** - All MonoBehaviour script GUIDs updated
4. **Asset References** - Configuration assets now properly linked

### Current System Status:

#### ✅ Core Scripts:
- `Video360Config.cs` - GUID: `a6ca54c90d5a04c8282a7341e678d4a7`
- `VideoController.cs` - GUID: `a4a99504d7d2848ab9c0364a454c59fe`
- `PlayerLookController.cs` - GUID: `4c04a3189b2a947f5bbb98300aaa83bc`
- `SimpleVideoServer.cs` - GUID: `d29eebe8339b441d8bfdc8eaf2ffd618`

#### ✅ Prefabs:
- `PF_VideoPlayer.prefab` - GUID: `6d867edff381545bbb0a83c50be009df`
- `PF_360SphereRig.prefab` - GUID: `7f3343ae698094aabaaec0c986c648cb`
- `VideoServerManager.prefab` - GUID: `d52d8a5b60eae4b7691843c9a5fee22e`

#### ✅ Scene:

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### 1. Open Unity and Check Console
```
1. Open Unity Editor
2. Load the project
3. Check Unity Console for errors
4. Should see NO compilation errors or GUID warnings
```

### 2. Open Demo Scene
```
1. Navigate to: Assets/Video360/Scenes/Video360_Demo.unity
2. Double-click to open the scene
3. Scene should load without any broken prefab warnings
```

### 3. Run System Verification
```
1. In the scene, find the "Video360Summary" GameObject (if present)
2. Right-click the Video360Summary component in Inspector
3. Select "Full System Check" from context menu
4. Check Console for verification results
```

### 4. Test Video Playback
```
1. Press Play in Unity Editor
2. HTTP Server should start automatically
3. Console should show: [VideoServer] Started at http://localhost:8080/
4. Video should begin loading (may show placeholder until real video is added)
```

## 🎯 Next Steps for Users

### 1. Add Your Video Content
```bash
# Create video directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p Assets/StreamingAssets/Videos

# Add your 360° MP4 video file
cp your_360_video.mp4 Assets/StreamingAssets/Videos/sample360.mp4
```

### 2. Test the System
```bash
1. Open Video360_Demo.unity scene
2. Press Play
3. Check console for "[VideoServer] Started at http://localhost:8080/"
4. Mouse/touch to look around (even with placeholder video)
```

### 3. Configure for Your Content
```bash
1. Select Assets/Video360/Resources/Config/DefaultVideoConfig.asset
2. Update videoURL or assign videoClip
3. Choose appropriate renderMode and stereoLayout
4. Test with your content
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Unity Console Shows Errors:
1. **"Could not extract GUID"** - These should be fixed now, refresh Unity if persisting
2. **"Broken text PPtr"** - These should be resolved, reimport Video360 folder if needed
3. **Script compilation errors** - All scripts should compile cleanly now

### If Scene Won't Load:
1. Check that all prefab files exist in Prefabs folder
2. Verify scene file integrity by opening in text editor
3. All GUID references should be non-zero and valid

### If HTTP Server Won't Start:
1. Check that VideoServerManager prefab is in scene
2. Verify port 8080 is not in use by other applications
3. SimpleVideoServer script should compile without errors
